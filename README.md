My personal website created by forking the [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io) project. 

# TODO

- Update CV to include all undegraduate research experience
- Add a line in bio / cv about research experience in many different fields in computer science (maybe borrow from essay), giving me a unique perspective on many DL problems
