Hi, I'm Sid, a first year PhD Student studying Computer Science at UCLA. 
I'm advised by Professor [Baharan Mirzasoleiman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~baharan/). 
I'm currently interested in understanding and exploiting data in multi-modal learning and self-supervised learning (data pruning, dataset distillation, data poisoning etc.)

Feel free to hit me up to talk about any of these topics!

In my free time, I like to write ([https://medium.com/@sjoshi804](https://medium.com/@sjoshi804)), cook, play chess and run.
