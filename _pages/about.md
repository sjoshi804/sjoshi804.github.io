Hi, I'm Sid, a first year PhD Student studying Computer Science at UCLA. 
I'm advised by Professor [Baharan Mirzasoleiman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~baharan/). 
I'm currently interested in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Neural Network Pruning. In particular, with the current NAS methods pruning down overparameterized 
neural networks to desired candidates, I'm generally curious about how to 
effectively evaluate different neural network architectures. 

Feel free to hit me up to talk about any of these topics!

In my free time, I like to write ([https://medium.com/@sjoshi804](https://medium.com/@sjoshi804)), cook, play chess and run.
